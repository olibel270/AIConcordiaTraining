==============================

Linear Algebra
==============
It is assumed that you have taken an introductory class in linear algebra.

Coding Experience
=================
The implementation of machine learning algorithms will be done using Python. While expertise in Python is not necessary, it is assumed that
the participants have basic experience with programming in any language. Please follow the following section to setup your Python environment 
and be ready for the workshop.

Mathematical Bases
==================
In order to be ready for the workshop, we will cover here the mathematical bases that are essential to understand the implementation of
the basic Machine learning algorithms.
